please refactor this to a single tsx file to be used with expo+reactnative+typescript. export it as DiplomaGenerator to be called in my app function (which already contains a safe area view). keep the design exactly as is please.

Important:
- if using [expo-image-picker] : `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions` have been deprecated. Use `ImagePicker.MediaType` or an array of `ImagePicker.MediaType` instead.
- use safe area view from "react-native-safe-area-context"
